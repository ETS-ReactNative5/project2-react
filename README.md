# The Daily Orchid

The live demo can be found here.

## Summary

**Context**
The Daily Orchid is a mobile-responsive lightweight orchid database platform for users to discover orchid species and add favourites to their account, and for orchid-growers to share their own hybrids with the world.

**Justification for the App**
This web app is akin to a mini-Wiki, a lightweight platform with information presented in easy-to-digest nuggets. The features are also self-explanatory and simple-to-use. This makes it easy for users to share information with others. Anyone is able to post and edit, stoking the community spirit of sharing and learning.

## UI/UX

### **Strategy**

_Organisation_
* Objective: To raise awareness and educate the public about orchids, and encourage users to share knowledge about their favourite orchids. To also set up an online community of orchid-lovers.

_User_
* Objective: Learn of new orchid species (800 genera and 30000 species in the world) hitherto unbeknownst to them. Share knowledge of other species and append to the database to enrich other users. Share their own orchid hybrid creations with the world. Discover information about species which can further fuel their love for orchids. Edit existing incorrect information about a species in the database.

* Needs: Platform with simple features such as checkboxes and dropdowns which allows for easy sharing

* Demographics:
    * Orchid lovers who are already knowledgeable about the orchid family and many species
    * Users who may not be as knowledgeable about the orchid family, but are enthusiastic about learning and sharing
    * Orchid-growers who have hybridised their own creations

* Pain point: Can be intimidating to post in a full-fledge sharing website such as Wikipedia
